					<h3>Assisting children with little or no English</h3>
					<span>We work with schools and volunteers to establish language support placements in primary schools. The role of the language support volunteer is to offer valuable in-class social and academic support to children who speak little or no English, many of whom are recently arrived in the UK. Our growing network of volunteers are able to offer support with a wide range of languages; please contact us to find out how we could support a child in your school.<br><br>
Our core goals are to enable children to engage with their learning, to develop confidence, to communicate with their peers and teachers more effectively, and to develop new friendships.

						<h3>Personal Development</h3>
						<span>For our volunteers, benefits may include taking opportunities to spend time working with members of their local community, practising language skills, developing confidence in a work environment, and learning new skills for future employment. School placements provide excellent opportunities for volunteers to gain experience working in schools and to develop their own spoken English.<br><br>Please contact us with enquiries: <a href="mailto:info@ealvolunteers.co.uk" target="_top">info@ealvolunteers.co.uk</a></span>
