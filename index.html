					<h3>Assisting children with little or no English</h3>
					<span>EAL Volunteers work with schools to provide classroom support for children with little or no English. Commonly, these children are newly arrived in the UK. As well as this, our school placements provide excellent opportunities for volunteers to gain experience working in schools and to develop their own spoken English. Our growing network of volunteers is able to offer support with a wide range of languages; please contact us to find out how we could support a child in your setting.
This may be helping the pupil to feel engaged with their learning, to develop confidence, to communicate with their peers and teachers, and to develop new friendships.
