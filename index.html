					<h3>For children with little or no English</h3>
					<span>EAL Volunteers work with schools to support children with little or no English, as well as provide opportunities for our volunteers to gain experience in an English speaking environment.

Our network of volunteers are able to offer support with a wide range of languages, including Polish, Spanish, Arabic, Urdu and Chinese Mandarin.

As an organisation run by teachers, we understand the challenges involved when supporting children who speak very little English. We offer advice and resources to help our volunteers work effectively with pupils, as well as helping them to feel engaged with their learning and to develop new friendships.
